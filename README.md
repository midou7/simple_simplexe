# Simple_simplexe method
This is a simple simplexe method to solve LP maximisation problems under canonic positive normal forms. This python program needs `numpy` library to work.
# How to run
To run this program you need to have `python3` and `numpy`. You can solve optimisation problems given as the file  given `test` in this repo. The `simple_simplexe.py` file allow you to generate random lp problems and solve them. You can run it as follows:
    1- `python3 simple_simplexe.py test` This will solve for the lp problem given in the test file.
    2-  `python3 simple_simplexe.py` This will generate a random lp problem and solve it. The random problem will be saved as `file_test` and an lp file `file_test.lp` will also be generated.
